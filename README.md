After 6 months of working and learning with ReactJs (from zero) i decided to make the previous MMO proyect in my repository from scratch.
With this my intention is to apply everything I learned in all this months.

in this new project, unlike the previous one, my approach was to mainly use react libraries.<br />
Those were: <br />
-Material-ui <br />
-React-parallax <br />
-React-Typed <br />
-Recharts. <br />

This project is not finished yet, it needs to be polished and my intention is to integrate it to a mocked API or, even better, a API made by me.
